# State Management in React

In the this repo I experiment with different packages and native hooks of react to _manage the state_. This repo is inspired by Mr. [Jack Herrington](https://github.com/jherr/fcc-state), here is the [video](https://youtu.be/-bEzt5ISACA?si=NpVFS0QjnV8ZZ0rU) if you're interested.

You can find all the implementation in `src/stores/`, it contains:

- native context and `useReducer`.
- indirect state management with `react-query`.
- unidirectional modal with **Zustand**.
- bidirectional modal with **Valtio**.
- atomic modal with **Jotai**.
